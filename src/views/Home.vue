          Paulieâ€™s Pizza seeks to take the world of classic Italian food into the modern day of convenience and speed!
        </p>
        <p>
          We work together with businesses that might not normally be able to handle online delivery, and provide them with the
          recipes and infrastructure to start selling locally.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a hungry customer, that means you can quickly start an order and get great food delivered to you
          entirely online while supporting local businesses!
